Samegame - Python3
========

This is my solution for the (German) programming contest: https://pwb.asta-wedel.de/SS15-SameGame/index.html

You need:
- `python3`
- In near future probably `numpy`

The only relevant file is `samegame.py`. Start it by opening a terminal/command line, navigate to the directory of the file and start it by typing `python3 samegame.py -h` to see usage.

Syntax in the python script (not so very strict):
- `board` is the whole board
- `element` is one coordinate of the board
- `field` or `area` is one connected area of elements with the same color (except for 0)
